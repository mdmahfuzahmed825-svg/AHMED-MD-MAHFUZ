C program- tStudent Result management System
Student Result Management System 
Project Title: 
Project Description: 
The purpose of this project is to develop an efficient C program for managing student academic records. 
The system will allow users to add, update, search, and display student details while automatically 
calculating grades. It aims to reduce manual effort and help teachers or institutions store and access 
results in a well-organized manner. 
Main Features / Functionalities: 
1. Add new student details such as name, ID, department, and marks. 
2. Automatically calculate total marks, average, and grade. 
3. Search for specific student records by ID or name. 
4. Edit or delete existing student information. 
5. Display all records in a clear tabular format. 
6. Save and load all data using files, so records remain after closing the program. 
C Programming Concepts to Be Used: 
This project will demonstrate several advanced C programming concepts, including: 
 File handling for saving and reading data. 
 Dynamic memory allocation (malloc, free) for flexible storage. 
 Structures and pointers to manage and access student data. 
 Modular programming by separating code into multiple .c and .h files. 
Expected Output / User Interface: 
The system will run in a menu-driven console. Users will interact through numbered options 
like: 
 Add Student 
 Display All 
 Search Record 
 Update Record 
 Delete Record 
 Save & Exit 
Each operation will display user-friendly messages and formatted results for clarity. 
Plan and Timeline: 
 Week 1: Design the data structure and plan the code modules. 
 Week 2: Develop core functions (add, display, search). 
 Week 3: Implement file handling and test memory allocation. 
 Week 4: Final testing, documentation, and upload to GitHub.
